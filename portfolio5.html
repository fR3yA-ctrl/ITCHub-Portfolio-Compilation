        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A motherboard is the central hub of any computing system, facilitating communication between key components such as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM), and other peripherals. Its primary function is to provide power, integrate hardware, and allow data to flow between the system's components.</p>
        <p>Motherboards are available in a variety of sizes and designs, each tailored for specific applications—from compact desktop setups to powerful server configurations. Over time, the evolution of motherboard form factors has allowed for the development of systems with varying levels of performance, expandability, and compactness. This study explores the history, types, and specifications of motherboards, shedding light on how they shape modern computing.</p>
        <p>The history of motherboards traces back to the early personal computers, where the first motherboards were basic circuit boards containing only essential components like the CPU and memory. The 1980s marked a significant shift when Compaq introduced motherboards compatible with Intel CPUs, breaking away from IBM's architecture. This move set the foundation for the widespread adoption of Intel-based systems and allowed other manufacturers like Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI to rise in prominence. By the 1990s, Intel had firmly established its dominance in the market, leading to the introduction of new motherboard designs, each aiming to meet the changing demands of consumers and businesses alike.</p>
        <p>Today, Asus remains the largest producer of motherboards globally, contributing to innovations in form factors that cater to everything from entry-level systems to high-performance workstations.</p>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>Motherboards differ significantly in terms of build, features, and the intended use of each form factor. The ATX (Advanced Technology Extended) motherboard is a standard in desktop systems, offering a balanced combination of expandability and performance. With support for one CPU, multiple memory slots (up to eight), and several PCIe slots, ATX boards are suited for gaming, professional workstations, and general desktop use. Typically featuring modern Intel or AMD chipsets, these motherboards use UEFI firmware for better system management and support for various built-in features like multiple SATA ports, USB connectivity, and onboard audio. However, their larger size means they require bigger computer cases, making them less ideal for compact setups.</p>
        <p>Micro ATX, a smaller version of the ATX, offers many of the same features but with a reduced number of expansion slots—usually up to four. While it retains compatibility with ATX cases, it is a more cost-effective solution and ideal for budget or entry-level builds. It still supports modern Intel and AMD chipsets and has essential built-in features such as USB ports and onboard audio. However, due to fewer expansion slots, it’s better suited for users who don’t need extensive peripheral support.</p>
        <p>Mini ITX boards cater to ultra-compact systems, often supporting only a single CPU slot and a maximum of two memory slots. Despite their small size, Mini ITX boards can still accommodate low-power Intel or AMD chipsets and offer integrated features like WiFi and Bluetooth. These boards are perfect for space-saving applications, such as home theater PCs or small, energy-efficient workstations, but their lack of expansion slots limits their capability for future upgrades.</p>
        <p>The eXtended ATX (eATX) motherboard, designed for high-performance setups, supports dual CPUs and up to eight RAM slots. Ideal for professional-grade workstations and servers, eATX motherboards are equipped with advanced Intel or AMD chipsets and feature multiple PCIe slots for GPUs or other expansion cards. The larger size of eATX boards allows for better cooling and more robust built-in features, such as dual LAN ports and RAID support, making them perfect for demanding applications that require significant processing power and memory.</p>
        <p>Introduced to address cooling issues, the BTX (Balanced Technology Extended) motherboard features a unique layout with components arranged for better airflow. While it offered support for modern chipsets, its design never gained wide acceptance, leading to its eventual discontinuation. BTX boards typically feature fewer PCIe slots and limited modern support, and while they improved thermal performance, they did not meet compatibility demands and were not widely adopted.</p>
        <p>The LPX (Low-Profile Extended) motherboard, popular in the 1990s, was characterized by a compact design that used riser cards for expansion slots. Despite its small profile, it offered limited PCIe slots and lacked support for modern peripherals, resulting in its eventual obsolescence.</p>
        <p>For ultra-compact systems, Mini-STX motherboards are a modern solution with a small footprint. These boards still provide upgradable CPU slots and support various chipsets. With minimal PCIe slots and a focus on energy efficiency, Mini-STX motherboards are ideal for small, energy-efficient computers that require basic functionality, such as in home theater systems or minimalist desktops.</p>
        <p>In summary, motherboards come in various form factors that cater to different needs. Larger boards like ATX and eATX emphasize performance and expandability, making them suitable for gaming and high-end workstations. Smaller boards like Mini ITX and Mini-STX cater to compact, energy-efficient builds, suitable for home use or specialized applications. Each form factor is designed to balance space, expandability, and performance to meet specific user requirements.</p>
