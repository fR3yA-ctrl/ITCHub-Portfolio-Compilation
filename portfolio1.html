        <h2>Brief History</h2>
		<h1> Early Foundations </h2>
        <p>The history of computer science dates back to the 19th century with the pioneering efforts of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. Key milestones include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The development of the Analytical Engine in the 1830s (Babbage and Lovelace).</li>
            <li>The advent of the ENIAC, the first general-purpose computer, in 1946.</li>
            <li>The creation of early programming languages like Fortran (1957) and COBOL (1959).</li>
            <li>The rise of modern computing and internet technologies in the late 20th century.</li>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Computer Science, I have learned, is a field in which the study focuses on computers, algorithms, ways of processing information, as well as software and hardware development. The pillars of this field include mathematics and engineering. Mathematics provides the theoretical foundation necessary for developing algorithms and  understanding computational processes, while engineering principles are applied in the design and construction of computer systems. </p>
		
		<p>In my perspective, despite the different focuses of the mentioned computing disciplines—Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems (IS), Information Technology (IT), and Software Engineering—there is great importance in acquiring at least the basics or fundamental skills of all these disciplines. This broad knowledge base equips individuals with a versatile skill set that is valuable in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Understanding the basics of each discipline allows for a more holistic approach to problem-solving and innovation.</p>
		
		<p> Furthermore, as the world of programming and computer science continues to develop, society evolves alongside it. This realization has highlighted to me that technology is not just a tool but a driving force shaping the future. As technology advances, it brings about significant changes in how we live and work. Those who fail to adapt to these changes risk being left behind. The ability to stay current with technological advancements is crucial, and acquiring foundational knowledge in various computing disciplines can provide a competitive edge in this dynamic field.</p>

		<p> What is particularly intriguing about computer science is the combination of theoretical knowledge and practical application. While coding, algorithms, and programming might seem abstract, their application involves understanding and adapting these elements to solve real- world problems. This adaptability is key—one must not only be proficient in writing code but also possess the ability to modify and improve solutions as challenges evolve. This process of continuous learning and adjustment is what makes the field both challenging and rewarding. </p>
		
		<p> In conclusion, the intersection of theoretical principles and practical application in computer science underscores the need for a diverse skill set and adaptability. Embracing foundational knowledge across disciplines, staying abreast of technological advancements, and continuously refining problem-solving skills are essential for thriving in the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
