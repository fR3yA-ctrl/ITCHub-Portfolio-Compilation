        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This portfolio explores the concepts of Data, Information, and Information Systems, their differences, historical context, and roles in business and decision-making processes.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Data and Information Section -->
    <section class="content">
        <h2>Data and Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Data:</strong> Data refers to raw facts and unprocessed elements such as numbers, events, or transactions collected, recorded, and stored but not yet processed. In computing, data is typically translated into a digital binary form for efficient movement or processing.</p>
        <p><strong>Information:</strong> Information is processed data, made meaningful through operations such as sorting, adding, comparing, or rearranging. For example, individual item costs are data, while the total or average cost derived from these items is information.</p>
        <p>Information can also serve as input data for subsequent processes, highlighting the fluid nature between data and information.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Historical Context Section -->
    <section class="content">
        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>The concept of data in computing is rooted in the work of Claude Shannon, the father of information theory, who introduced binary digital concepts using Boolean logic applied to electronic circuits. Early input methods for computers included punch cards, followed by magnetic tape and hard disks.</p>

	  <!-- Types of Support Information Systems Section -->
    <section class="content">
        <h2>Types of Support Information Systems</h2>
        <h3>Operation Support Systems (OSS)</h3>
        <p>Operation Support Systems support and control routine business operations. They process transactions, monitor production processes, and enhance communication and collaboration across the enterprise. Key types of OSS include:</p>

        <h4>Transaction Process System (TPS)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Supports operations that design, market, produce, and deliver products.</li>
            <li>Integrates into Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to support the entire value chain.</li>
            <li>Can process data in two ways:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> Data is processed periodically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Processing:</strong> Data is processed immediately after the transaction occurs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Process Control Systems (PCS)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Automatically control production processes through continuous monitoring and adjustments.</li>
            <li>Example: A petroleum refinery uses electronic sensors linked to computers to monitor and adjust chemical processes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Enterprise Collaboration Systems (ECS)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhances collaboration within an organization using communication technologies like email, chat, video conferencing, and collaborative tools.</li>
            <li>Example: ECS helps facilitate teamwork by sharing resources and coordinating workflows across departments.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Management Support Systems Section -->
    <section class="content">
        <h2>Management Support Systems (MSS)</h2>
        <h3>Management Information Systems (MIS)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides pre-specified reports for decision-making and tracking organizational performance.</li>
            <li>Example: Sales managers can access daily reports via their network computers to monitor sales performance and generate reports.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Decision Support Systems (DSS)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Helps managers analyze data and make decisions by presenting interactive information.</li>
            <li>Example: Managers use DSS to run "what-if" scenarios, make pricing decisions, and analyze business models using large data sets.</li>
            <li>DSS is evolving into Business Intelligence (BI) systems, utilizing data mining and predictive analytics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Executive Information Systems (EIS)</h3>

        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Support of Knowledge Work Section -->
    <section class="content">
        <h2>Support of Knowledge Work</h2>
        <p>A large proportion of work in the information age revolves around knowledge work, supported by various systems:</p>

        <h4>Professional Support Systems (PSS)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Tools and software specialized for professionals like computer-aided design (CAD) for engineers or molecular modeling software for scientists.</li>

    <!-- Reflection Section -->
    <section class="content">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>In today’s digital age, the concepts of data and information are  essential to understanding how modern organizations function. Data and information are intertwined—data represents raw, unprocessed facts, while information is data that has been processed and understood by humans. Data, on its own, cannot convey meaning or insight until it undergoes a transformation. This transformation includes processes like extraction, cleansing, mapping, and loading, ensuring that data is structured in a format understandable by humans and can serve as actionable information. Without this conversion process, data remains a collection of unrefined elements.</p>

		<p>Information systems play a crucial role in optimizing the efficiency of this process. These systems integrate people, hardware, software, and processes to disseminate information accurately and efficiently across an organization. Through various types of information systems—like transaction Processing Systems (TPS) or Management Information Systems (MIS)—companies can streamline operations and enhance productivity. For example, enterprise systems such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) ensure that different departments, such as sales, finance, and  production, share up-to-date information, minimizing delays and errors. Such systems are vital for the smooth flow of information, ultimately aiding in better decision-making and strategy development.</p>

		<p>Despite the significant advantages, information systems are not without their downsides. One major concern is the potential for fraud, as unauthorized individuals may exploit these systems if proper security measures are not in place. Additionally, data loss can have
		catastrophic effects on organizations if regular backups are not performed. Another issue is GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out)—if the input data is of poor quality, the output, no matter how well processed, will be flawed. Furthermore, information systems can also lead to deception, especially when statistical data is misinterpreted or manipulated, leading to misguided decision-making.</p>

		<p>In conclusion, while data and information are fundamentally linked, the process that transforms data into information is crucial for operational efficiency. Information systems enable organizations to process and share information more effectively, but they must also
		navigate the inherent risks that come with technology. Understanding both the advantages and disadvantages of these systems ensures a balanced approach to leveraging them for business success.</p>
