        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Computers have evolved over decades, enabling advances in nearly every sector of modern life. These machines are categorized into various types based on their processing power, memory capacity, and intended use. In this study, we explore the key differences between Supercomputers, Mainframe Computers, Mini Computers, Workstations, Micro Computers, and Servers, focusing on their processing speeds, memory capacities, power consumption, and minimum usage requirements.</p>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        
        <h3>Supercomputers</h3>
        <p>Supercomputers are the epitome of computing power, designed to tackle the most complex calculations and simulations at extraordinarily high speeds. These machines are integral to scientific research, weather forecasting, nuclear simulations, and other specialized fields that require immense processing power. Their capability to process quadrillions of operations per second makes them indispensable for tasks that cannot be handled by conventional computing systems.</p>
        
        <h3>Mainframe Computers</h3>
        <p>Mainframe computers are large, powerful systems used for bulk data processing and managing extensive databases. They are highly reliable and can support thousands of users simultaneously, making them ideal for industries that require continuous, large-scale computing.</p>

        <h3>Mini Computers</h3>
        <p>Mini computers, once designed to serve as a bridge between powerful mainframes and more affordable microcomputers, are now largely obsolete. They were used for smaller-scale business and scientific applications that required more power than a microcomputer but didnâ€™t demand the full capabilities of a mainframe.</p>

        <h3>Workstations</h3>
        <p>Workstations are high-performance computers designed for specialized tasks such as scientific simulations, 3D rendering, and computer-aided design (CAD). They are more powerful than typical personal computers but less capable than supercomputers, making them ideal for professionals in fields that require high computational power but don't need the scale of supercomputing.</p>

        <h3>Microcomputers</h3>
        <p>Microcomputers, also known as personal computers (PCs), are the most common type of computer used for everyday tasks. These include web browsing, word processing, gaming, and multimedia consumption. Microcomputers are designed for individual use and are based on a microprocessor that integrates the CPU on a single chip.</p>

        <h3>Servers</h3>
        <p>Servers are specialized computers designed to manage, store, and distribute data or services across a network. Unlike personal computers, which are intended for single users, servers support many users simultaneously by managing network services, databases, and website hosting.</p>
